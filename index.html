                        <p>
                            Fungi are members of the group of eukaryotic organisms that includes unicellular microorganisms such as yeasts and molds, as well as multicellular fungi that produce familiar fruiting forms known as mushrooms. They are classified under the Fungi kingdom, with 4 phyla: Zygomycota, Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Deuteromycota. Fungi are fundamental for life on earth in their roles as symbionts. Many fungi break down complex organic biomolecules which play a critical role in the global carbon cycle. Fungi acquire their food by absorbing dissolved molecules, usually by secreting digestive enzymes into their environment.

                        <img align="left" src="assets/img/hypha.jpg" alt="hypha"/>
                        <p>
                            Mushrooms, the most recognized fungi are composed of their fruiting body above the ground, and their mycelium beneath the ground. Both portions of the mushroom are composed of hyphae, which are filamentous strands that build the mushroom. Other fungi such as yeasts are unicellular and do not contain hyphae.

                            During a mushroom's specific growing season, their hyphae mature and become capable of producing spores. These matured hyphae can be seen from above the ground and are often called the fruiting body of the mushroom. Each spore is a unicellular organism that sends out a single hypha that eventually develops into its own mycelium. The mycelium of a fungus consists of the vegetative network of hyphae spanning the soil underneath the fruiting body of a mushroom. It is analogous to the roots of a plant. When the hypha of one spore meets the hypha of another spore, sexual reproduction occurs, producing another mushroom.

                            Even the most experienced of mycologists and mushrooms hunters often have trouble 
                            telling if a mushroom is edible or not. Mushrooms can often look very similar, yet 
                            have dramatically different effects. An example is the morel, which is a prized mushroom
                            that mushroom enthusiasts look for everyday. These mushrooms are used by gourmet cooks, especially in french cuisine. However, there are species dubbed "false morels" which may have a similar appearance to the sought after morel. False morels contain the toxin gyromitrin, which can cause coma or death in significant quantities. Specifically, gyomitrin attacks the central nervous system and prevents the body from using vitamin B, effectively starving essential bodily functions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are even more dangers with edible mushrooms. Even if one correctly identifies a morel, these safe mushrooms have the capacity to contain toxins such as arsenic or lead, based upon the soil that they reside in. In truth, the safest way to enjoy mushrooms is to eat ones that are grown in a farm, where the soil is artificially set and the mushrooms are manually planted.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For foraging for mushrooms, some easy to identify ones are the giant puffball, wood ears, hedgehog fungus, portabella mushrooms, and many others. With a little research, these mushrooms can be easily found and safely prepared. It is always essential to be careful when trying to eat wild mushrooms. You can be old, bold, but not both. When in doubt, do not eat a mushroom. Poisoning from a mushroom can be serious, so make sure to be safe.

                            <p>
                                The most common cause for mushroom poisoning are people who misidenty toxic mushrooms as edible mushrooms and ingest them. Toxins are not directly involved with normal growth, development, or reproduction of mushrooms and are produced in specific biochemical pathways in the fungal cell. The effects of the toxins can range from slight bowel discomfort to death.
                            </p>
                            <p> 
                                There are many myths about identifying poisonous mushrooms. A common belief is that as long as the mushroom is thoroughly cooked it is safe to eat. There are some inedible mushrooms that become edible after special preparation. However, many of the toxins cannot be denatured by heat and thus cannot be rendered toxic free. Another common belief is that insects can tell which mushrooms are poinsonous and will avoid them. We should not assume that just because an insect isn't affect that we will also be unaffected. Fungi that are harmless to insects can still be toxic to humans. All poisonous mushrooms have a pointed cap is another common belief that is also untrue. The shape of the mushroom cap has absolutely no correlation to the presence or absence of mushroom toxins. It is also believed that all white mushrooms are safe to eat. The color of mushrooms is not a good way to decide if a mushroom is toxic. The destroying angel is a good example of a mushroom that is white but extremely toxic.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Symptoms of mushroom poisoning can vary from an upset stomach to life-threatening organ failure that results in death. Serious symptoms don't always occur immediately after eating. Sometimes the symptoms only occur after the toxin atacks the kidney or liver which might happen days or even weeks later. A common symptom of mushroom poisoning is gastrointestinal upset, where vomiting and diarrhea occur but don't usually cause any long-term damage.
